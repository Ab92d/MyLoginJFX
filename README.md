# MyLoginJFX

A Login Scripted writtern with JavaFx.

This login allows a user to enter text into the username and password textfields and press 'Sign in'. If username and password is correct the scene switches to a 
'You're logged in' scene. If the user doesn't the correct username and password combination, an alert pops ups informing the user they entered 'Incorrect username or
password'. 

There is a exit button for the user to close the progam when clicked and a reset button for the user to reset the textfields when clicked. The 'sign in' button is
disabled until the username and password text fields are not empty. I used a PasswordTextfield to turn the entered characters into bulletpoints for further security.

In the future I would like to add:
  - a checkbox/ to reveal/hide the password enetered
  - a help button to guide the user
  - a sign up page. This would require me to set up a database to store the data
  - animation
